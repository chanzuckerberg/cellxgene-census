# vignettes_wip

The `cellxgene.census` R package vignettes have been temporarily moved into this directory (instead of `vignettes/`) because they use too much memory to build in GitHub Actions workers (including the r-universe build, which doesn't allow us to set `--no-vignettes`). A final strategy for building them into the docsite is still pending.
