## What is a Census data release?

It is a Census build that is publicly hosted online. A Census build is
a [TileDB-SOMA](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA) collection with the Census data from [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) as specified in the [Census schema](cellxgene_census_docsite_schema.md).

Any given Census build is named with a unique tag, normally the date of build, e.g., `"2023-05-15"`.

### Long-term supported (LTS) Census releases

To enable data stability and scientific reproducibility, [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) plans to perform regular LTS Census data releases:

* Published online every six months for public access, starting on May 15, 2023.
* Available for public access for at least 5 years upon publication.

The most recent LTS Census data release is the default opened by the APIs and recognized as `census_version = "stable"`. To open previous LTS Census data releases, you can directly specify the version via its build date `census_version = "[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]"`.

Python

```python
import cellxgene_census
census = cellxgene_census.open_soma(census_version = "stable")
```

R

```r
library("cellxgene.census")
census <- open_soma(census_version = "stable")
```

### Weekly Census releases (latest)

[CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) ingests a handful of new datasets every week. To quickly enable access to these new data via the Census, CZ CELLxGENE Discover plans to perform weekly Census data releases:

* Available for public access for 1 month.

The most recent weekly release can be opened by the APIs by specifying `census_version = "latest"`.

Python

```python
import cellxgene_census
census = cellxgene_census.open_soma(census_version = "latest")
```

R

```r
library("cellxgene.census")
census <- open_soma(census_version = "latest")
```

## List of LTS Census data releases

### LTS 2023-12-15

### LTS 2023-05-15

Open this data release by specifying `census_version = "2023-05-15"` in future calls to `open_soma()`.

#### ðŸ”´ Errata ðŸ”´

##### Duplicate observations with  `is_primary_data = True`

In order to prevent duplicate data in analyses, each observation (cell) should be marked `is_primary data = True` exactly once in the Census. Since this LTS release, 243,569 observations have been identified that are represented at least twice with `is_primary_data = True`.

This issue will be corrected in the following LTS data release, by identifying and marking only one cell out of the duplicates as  `is_primary_data = True`.

If you wish to use this data release, you can consider filtering out all of these 243,569 cells by using the `soma_joinids` provided in this file [duplicate_cells_census_LTS_2023-05-15.csv.zip](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene-census/raw/773edab79bbdc78eccb26ec4f8211a9b4c98a71a/tools/cell_dup_check/duplicate_cells_census_LTS_2023-05-15.csv.zip). You can filter specific cells by using the `value_filter` or `obs_value_filter` of the querying API functions, for more information follow this [tutorial](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene-census/notebooks/api_demo/census_query_extract.html).
