The Census team is pleased to announce the release of the R package `cellxgene.census`, this has been long coming since our Python release back in May. Now, from R users can access the Census data which is the largest harmonized aggregation of single-cell data, composed of >30M cells and >60K genes.
 
With `cellxgene.census` users can access Census access and slice the data using cell or gene filters across hundreds of datasets. Users can fetch the data in an iterative fashion for bigger-than-memory slices of data, or export to [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) or [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html) objects.
