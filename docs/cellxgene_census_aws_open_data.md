## Census data available in AWS

The single-cell data from CZ CELLxGENE Discover included in Census (see [inclusion criteria](cellxgene_census_docsite_schema.md#data-included-in-the-census)) are available either as Census-wide TileDB files or individual H5AD files of the source datasets.

### Data release versioning

A data release is a Census build that is publicly hosted in AWS. A Census build is a TileDB-SOMA collection and its corresponding source H5AD files with the Census data from CZ CELLxGENE Discover.

Any given Census build is named with a unique `[tag]`, normally the date of build, e.g. "2023-05-15".

The are two types of data releases:

- Long-Term Supported (LTS).
- Weekly.

For more information and for a list of all LTS Census data releases available please refer to [Census data releases](cellxgene_census_docsite_data_release_info.md).

## How to access AWS Census data

### AWS CLI for programatic downloads

Users can bulk-download Census data via the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

For example, to download the H5ADs files of the Census LTS release `2023-07-25`, users can execute the following from a shell session:

```bash
aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://cellxgene-census-public-us-west-2/cell-census/2023-07-25/h5ads/ ./h5ads/
```

And to download the TileDB files:

```bash
aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3:/cellxgene-census-public-us-west-2/cell-census/2023-07-25/soma/ ./soma/
```

### CELLxGENE Census API (Python and R)

This is the recommend method for accessing Census data. Please follow the [Census API quick start guide](cellxgene_census_docsite_quick_start.md) for a full guide.

For example, in Python users can create an iterator for the cell metadata Data Frame as follows:

``` python
import cellxgene_census

with cellxgene_census.open_soma() as census:
    cell_metadata = census["census_data"]["homo_sapiens"].obs.read(
        value_filter = "sex == 'female' and cell_type in ['microglial cell', 'neuron']",
        column_names = ["assay", "cell_type", "tissue", "tissue_general", "suspension_type", "disease"]
    )
```

If a local copy of the Census data exists, users can access it by providing the path to the `soma/` folder.

``` python
import cellxgene_census

with cellxgene_census.open_soma(uri="local/path/to/soma/") as census:
   ...
```

### TileDB-SOMA API (Python and R)

The Census API provides convenience wrappers for TileDB-SOMA to access the Census Data hosted at AWS. Users can interact directly with the Census TileDB data directly via the TileDB-SOMA APIs. Please refer to the [TileDb-SOMA documentation](https://tiledbsoma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for full details on usage.

For example, in Python users can create an iterator for the cell metadata Data Frame as follows:

``` python
config = {
    "vfs.s3.region": "us-west-2",
    "vfs.s3.no_sign_request": "true",
    "py.init_buffer_bytes": 1 * 1024**3,
    "soma.init_buffer_bytes": 1 * 1024**3,
}

ctx = tiledbsoma.options.SOMATileDBContext()
ctx = ctx.replace(tiledb_config=config)

uri = "s3://cellxgene-census-public-us-west-2/cell-census/2023-07-25/soma/"

with tiledbsoma.open(uri, context=ctx) as census:
    cell_metadata = census["census_data"]["homo_sapiens"].obs.read(
        value_filter = "sex == 'female' and cell_type in ['microglial cell', 'neuron']",
        column_names = ["assay", "cell_type", "tissue", "tissue_general", "suspension_type", "disease"]
    )
```
