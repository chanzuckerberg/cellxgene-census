**Last edited**: April, 2023.

## What is a Census data release?

It is a Census build that is publicly hosted online. A Census build is 
a [TileDB-SOMA](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA) collection with the Census data from [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) as specified in the [Census schema](cellxgene_census_docsite_schema.md). 

### Long-term supported (LTS) Cell Census releases

To enable data stability and scientific reproducibility, [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) plans to perform regular LTS Census data releases:

* Published online every six months for public access, starting on May 15, 2023.
* Available for public access for at least 5 years upon publication.
 

### Weekly Census release (latest)

[CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) ingests a handful of new datasets every week. To quickly enable access to these new data via the Census, [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) plans to perform weekly Census data releases:

* Published online every Monday for public access, except for CZI holidays. 
* Available for public access for 1 week or until the next latest release is performed, whichever is the longest.
