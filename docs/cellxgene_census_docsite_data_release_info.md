## What is a Census data release?

It is a Census build that is publicly hosted online. A Census build is 
a [TileDB-SOMA](https://github.com/single-cell-data/TileDB-SOMA) collection with the Census data from [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) as specified in the [Census schema](cellxgene_census_docsite_schema.md). 

### Long-term supported (LTS) Census releases

To enable data stability and scientific reproducibility, [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) plans to perform regular LTS Census data releases:

* Published online every six months for public access, starting on May 15, 2023.
* Available for public access for at least 5 years upon publication.
 
The latest LTS Census data release is the default opened by the APIs and recognized as the `census_version = "stable"`.

Python

```python
import cellxgene_census
census = cellxgene_census.open_soma()
```

R

```r
library("cellxgene.census")
census <- open_soma()
```

### Weekly Census release (latest)

[CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) ingests a handful of new datasets every week. To quickly enable access to these new data via the Census, [CZ CELLxGENE Discover](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) plans to perform weekly Census data releases:

* Available for public access for 1 week or until the next latest release is performed, whichever is the longest.

The weekly release can be opened by the APIs by specifying `census_version = "latest"`.

Python

```python
import cellxgene_census
census = cellxgene_census.open_soma(census_version = "latest")
```

R

```r
library("cellxgene.census")
census <- open_soma(census_version = "latest")
```

## List of LTS Census data releases

### LTS 2023-05-15

Open this data release by specifying `census_version = "2023-06-28"` in future calls to `open_soma()`

#### 🔴 Erratum 🔴  

There are 243,569 number of cells labelled as `is_primary_data = True` for which a fraction of them the label is incorrect. 

Such label indicates that a cell is the primary representation of an observation, otherwise a cell is deemed to be a duplicate representation. Based on their count vectors, these 243,569 number of cells are represented at least twice with `is_primary_data = True`.

This issue will be corrected in the following LTS data release, by identifying and marking only one cell out of the duplicates as  `is_primary_data = True`.

If you wish to use this data release, you can consider filtering out all of these 243,569 cells by using the `soma_joinids` provided in this file [duplicate_cells_census_LTS_2023-05-15.csv.zip](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene-census/raw/773edab79bbdc78eccb26ec4f8211a9b4c98a71a/tools/cell_dup_check/duplicate_cells_census_LTS_2023-05-15.csv.zip). You can filter specific cells by using the `value_filter` or `obs_value_filter` of the querying API functions, for more information follow this [tutorial](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene-census/notebooks/api_demo/census_query_extract.html).
